      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome! Neoflux ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you play <strong>CMMHS Hunt Mission</strong> (the "Game"). By using the Game you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Device &amp; Usage Data</strong> — device model, operating system, unique identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), IP address, crash reports, session length, gameplay data and other diagnostic data.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data</strong> — information used to serve and measure ads, including ad identifiers (Advertising ID on Android / IDFA on iOS where available).</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</strong> — local storage and cookies used by third parties (ad networks and analytics) to provide, measure and personalise advertising and analytics.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>To operate, maintain and improve the Game.</li>
        <li>To provide in-game features, updates, and support.</li>
        <li>To serve personalised or non-personalised ads via third-party ad networks such as Google AdMob.</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Ads and Third-Party Advertising — Google AdMob</h2>
      <p>The Game displays adverts served by third-party advertising partners, including Google AdMob. These third parties may collect information about your device and use cookies or advertising identifiers to serve and measure ads. We do not control how AdMob or other ad networks use this data; please review their privacy policies for details.</p>
      <p class="meta">Typical ad data may include advertising identifiers (Android Advertising ID, IDFA), device model, OS, IP address, and inferred interests for ad personalisation.</p>
      <p>If you wish to opt out of personalised ads, use your device settings (such as <code>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</code> on Android) or platform privacy controls. You can also limit ad tracking via your device's privacy settings.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Analytics &amp; Crash Reporting</h2>
      <p>We may use analytics services (for example, Google Analytics for Firebase) to understand how people use the Game and to improve it. These services collect usage information (such as events, session durations, and crash logs). This data is aggregated or pseudonymised and does not identify you personally.</p>
